## Design
### Colour Scheme
The two main colours used are white (background) & black for the text. Simply because black text on white background provides the highest readability. I have also introduced a blue colour in certains aspects to provide calmness.
### Typography
The Abel font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Abel is picked for it's readbility and cleaness when added to the website.
### Imagery
The background hero image was designed to capture the users attention whilst also showing the purpose of the website. The image is simple but strong, providing the user a message with what our gym can offer them.
### Wireframes
Figma was used to sketch my first template.
