## Design
### Colour Scheme
The two main colours used are white (background) & black for the text. Simply because black text on white background provides the highest readability. I have also introduced a blue colour in certains aspects to provide calmness.
### Typography
The Abel font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Abel is picked for it's readbility and cleaness when added to the website.
### Imagery
The background hero image was designed to capture the users attention whilst also showing the purpose of the website. The image is simple but strong, providing the user a message with what our gym can offer them.

## Features

### Navigation Bar

Featured on the top right hand-side of the page, the full responsive navigation bar includes internal links to the sign up section, facilities section, reviews section and about us section which allows the users to to easily navigate to the section they want.

I have also added a hover style to give the user clarity when selecting from the navigation bar.

### The Landing Image

The landing includes a hero image with text overlay providing a powerful and motivational statement which captures the user attention.

I have kept the section simple and avoided to much text or multiple images as i just want to introduce the user to Gym Bros.


### Sign Up Form

This section was position straight under the hero image for ease of use for the user. It will allow the user to enquire about joining the Gym Bros community. The user will be able specify if they would like to sign up for the off peak or anytime membership. The user will be asked to submit their full name and email address.

### Facilities

This section will allow the user to see exactly what services and facilities the gym has to offer. Icons were used to draw the user attention to the selling points of the membership. Also helps break up the sections as too much text will leade to a poor user experience.

## Testing

## Further Testing
- Tests were done to make sure the website worked smoothly in different browsers (Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari.)
- Devtools were used to verify that the website is responsive on different viewports.
- Tests were done to ensure the sign up form is operational and that email field only accepts a valid email format.

## Known Bugs
- After testing my HTML code in W3C Markup Validator, it confirmed that i had two bugs. One extra ending div without an opening and a span was used in a incorrect way.

- i deleted the extra div and chagned the span into a div element.

## Known Issues
- For smaller screen clarity, i would have added a hamburger icon to shorten the webpage and clean up the design.
- Under the reviews section, i would add card layouts for the text again for clairty and a better user experience.
