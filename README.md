## Design
### Colour Scheme
The two main colours used are white (background) & black for the text. Simply because black text on white background provides the highest readability. I have also introduced a blue colour in certains aspects to provide calmness.
### Typography
The Abel font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Abel is picked for it's readbility and cleaness when added to the website.
### Imagery
The background hero image was designed to capture the users attention whilst also showing the purpose of the website. The image is simple but strong, providing the user a message with what our gym can offer them.
### Wireframes
Figma was used to sketch my first template.

## Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section
### First Time Visitor Goals
As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.

Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a Hero Image with Text and a "Learn More" Call to action button.
The main points are made immediately with the hero image
The user has two options, click the call to action buttons or scroll down, both of which will lead to the same place, to learn more about the organisation.
As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.
At the bottom of the first 3 pages there is a redirection call to action to ensure the user always has somewhere to go and doesn't feel trapped as they get to the bottom of the page.
On the Contact Us Page, after a form response is submitted, the page refreshes and the user is brought to the top of the page where the navigation bar is.
As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their following on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.

Once the new visitor has read the About Us and What We Do text, they will notice the Why We are Loved So Much section.
The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.
At the bottom of the Contact Us page, the user is told underneath the form, that alternatively they can contact the organisation on social media which highlights the links to them.

## Further Testing
- Tests were done to make sure the website worked smoothly in different browsers (Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari.)
- Devtools were used to verify that the website is responsive on different viewports.
- Tests were done to ensure the sign up form is operational and that email field only accepts a valid email format.
